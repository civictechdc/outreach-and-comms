Dear <receiver_name>,

We want to express our gratitude for the amazing work you are doing to support <nonprofit_mission>. At our core, we believe that non-profits are in the best position to tackle some of the most pressing local challenges, and we want to assist in any way we can.

Code For DC is committed to helping non-profits and organizations address civic and social issues within the DC community. We bring together a passionate team of technologists and volunteers who work closely with local groups to better understand their challenges and develop technical solutions or products to help them achieve their goals.

We're proud of some of the recent projects we've completed, such as
* Helping the DC Abortion Fund transition from excel spreadsheets to an online application that streamlines case tracking and provides their clients with easier access to care.
* Created a site that allows DC residents to easily find and understand their local ANCs, enabling them to get involved politically at the local level.
* We partnered with the Georgetown Law clinic to create an automated tool that helps people get convictions or records expunged as laws have changed.

Despite the many technological advances in recent years, many non-profits lack the funding, technical skills, awareness, or time necessary to take advantage of new tools and streamline their efforts. At Code For DC, we recognize that non-profits have an intimate understanding of their issues, problems, and pain points, and we are eager to help wherever we can.

Our team of volunteers includes diverse technologists and activists who are passionate about service and addressing local civic and social issues. We regularly meet both online and in person to brainstorm and create technology to address community needs.

If your non-profit has specific challenges or needs and is interested in receiving free support from CodeForDC and our community of volunteers, please respond to this email. We'd be happy to set up a time to discuss your needs and explore ways we can help.

Thank you for taking the time to consider our offer. We look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you and discussing potential ideas in greater detail.

Best,

<sender_name>
